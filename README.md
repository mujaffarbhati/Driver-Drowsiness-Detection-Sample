## Overview

Driver Drowsiness Detection is a critical application that employs advanced algorithms to monitor driver behavior in real-time. By analyzing factors such as eye closure, head movement, and other cues, the system can identify instances of drowsiness and alert the driver to take necessary precautions.

## Features

- Real-time drowsiness detection using computer vision and machine learning.
- Audible alerts for drivers when signs of drowsiness are detected.
- Performance metrics to assess the accuracy of the detection system.

## Installation

- Clone this repository to your local machine using `git clone https://github.com/RumshaShaikh/VigilEye-Drowsiness-Detection.git`
- For dataset installation use this link `https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rakibuleceruet/drowsiness-prediction-dataset/download?datasetVersionNumber=1`

## Usage

1. Navigate to the project directory.
2. Run the detection system using `DD1.ipynb` and `DD2.ipynb`.
3. Follow the prompts to calibrate and customize the detection settings.
4. Drive safely while the system monitors your alertness.
5. If drowsiness is detected, the system will issue alerts to prevent potential accidents.
